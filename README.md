**Summary**

Ok here we go. AI in a week. Let's do this! 

**Speculation**

The lecture from Peter Binggesser was suprisingful very engaging and clear. He's a great lecturer. The lecture makes AI seem very accessible, which I originally thought was out of my reach in understanding. Whats interesting is the conversational aspect of AI "design" and how the data is packaged and taught to be interpreted. I am now interested in learning more about data. Data in itself seems objective but when it is packaged in such a way like AI, it becomes subjective, because of how the data is recalled and what data is included and not. 

In any case, I am very excited about making an chatbox of me on my portfolio site. I am thinking of questions someone might want to ask about my work or who I am. I am a long way. I can barely ask it to say who I am. I imagine a robot similar to the one I met at the Japanese museum of emerging science and technology Miraikan in Tokyo.

**Reflection**

My mind is blown. I originally had some biasses on AI but now I am interested in learning more.

# Weekly Report 8 - October 26, 2023 

**Summary**
Woohoo! We finished our project, now called, Ghostbuddies. I am really proud of our team who rallied to make this happen. We took on challenges and pivoted when we needed to and proud of the outcome. 

**Speculation**

This week started off slowly. Aylish and Ankur had the code pretty much figured out light sensor for the ghost. We had to figure out how they would talk to each other. We pivoted from ditance sensing because  it would not be possible without more hardware or extra external processes, and math. We also wanted to avoid math. This was only after talking to a few classmates and design specialists. We decided that the light sensor was enough for our concept to still work. 

Since they had the code down I decided to focus on the build. I used the instructables files to 3D print the chassis. I ordered some omni directional wheels but it would not arrive in time. So I decided to print my own. What a waste of two days! The quality of the print was ok but too rough for the functionality of the wheels. They didn't turn and took to long to build. So I pivoted and found some lego wheels to try. The design of chassis would not work without the omni directional wheels, so I pivoted again and laser printed a forward directional ghost design platform. We then tested the wheels to see which was best and used the maker space to really hack this thing together.

Although, Ive been pretty much hands off with the code, I decided we needed to move forward with the Hunter code and their communication. Thank goodness TJ put together a couple of tutorials on how to connect the OLED and the beginnings of the publisher subscriber setup. I soldered the OLED to Sparkfun board. (I love soldering BTW!) I then created some code with Reina's help to initiate a time stamp on the screen. Ankur and I created a team for the 2 photons on his account. After he got the wheels to work with the light sensor. He took the two home to finesse the code to talk to each other. Again thanks to tutorials, our classmates, and teaching team we figured out how to make it work. 

On the last day, we really pulled our resources together to finish the build. Which was actually very tricky because of the wheels and the electronics setup. We got it to work and in the evening created our video. Aylish had already put together a script so that was helpful. We then asynchronisely added our voices and process videos. 

**Reflection**
I am glad I am a maker at heart because we had to pivot many times because of the resources, timing, and overall knowledge we had in putting an electronics kit together. I am thankful I had a really proactive and engaging team.

# Weekly Report - October 12, 2023 

**Summary**
This week we refined the idea with our ghost and hunter game. We started thinking about the interactions, materials, and actual build. 

<img width="400" alt="Ghostly" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-ollioll/blob/main/weekly-reports/week%207/Screen%20Shot%202023-10-12%20at%2011.01.24%20AM.png">

**Speculation**
We are not starting from scratch but reaching out to the teaching team and also online sources like instructables or [docs.idew.org](https://docs.idew.org/internet-of-things-project/references-for-wiring-and-coding/continuous-rotation-servo-motor) to have a starting point on the code and build. I found an interesting build on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Iota-Omni-HSR-Robot-Rover-MAKE-Course/) that can be adapted for our ghost. Figuring out the interactions and refining them is key to making finding out what works or doesn't work. We made progress on the code. Ankur figured out the 'hot/cold' feature.

**Reflection**
Its been interesting to be very new to building electronics but have the understanding of an industrial designer on how its built. We have a good team. Some of us are more technical, some more big picture, and one of us can actually make and build. Next steps is to figure out how to put the pieces together in order to make a mockup.

# Weekly Report - October 5, 2023 

**Summary**
This week we formed groups and generated ideas for Project 2. Our group focused on the task of cleaning, specifically cleaning counters. We did a brainstorm on how we can create the design. Then we create a user scenario and list of actions the robot needed to produce. When the group presented the idea, they got the feeddback that the idea was cool but we didnt have time to really accomplish object sensing, moving, and cleaning. So the team pivoted to create "Ghostly." An interactive 'hot/cold' game. 

<img width="400" alt="brainstorm" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-ollioll/blob/main/weekly-reports/week%206/IMG_1992%20copy.jpg">

**Speculation**
We brainstormed a few ideas like an arm picking up items off the counter. Also a cobweb cleaning spider. But abondened the idea for its difficulty. I came up with the idea of Wipey. An robot that looks like a dish towel at first glance but it moves slowly pusing items out of the way as it cleans the counter. I found some researc h while doing my zine on soft robotics. There are some interesting research on biomimicry to mimic movements of sea creatures  moving on sea floor. There are also some helpful tutorials on instructables on how to accomplish the design and programming of the machine. 

<img width="400" alt="Wipey" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-ollioll/blob/main/weekly-reports/week%206/IMG_2056%202%20copy.jpg">

[Soft Robotics - Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Soft-Robotics/) 


**Reflection**
Upon discussion, "Wipey" would be difficult. So we just made the sensing action 'hot/cold' and made it into a game. We are still working on the details of the design.

# Weekly Report 4 - September 20, 2023 

**Summary**

Boom! Project 1 done. I did all my weekly reflections which I didn't know we had to do, but it was great to reflect as a whole about this project and my experience. I hate to say it, but TDF my be one of my favorite classes so far. Im excited about the next project. I love stuff the gifts of potential we got this week. 

**Speculation**

I was so impresseds with my progress in this course and the conenctions I have been making to my own design interests that I decided to make a another repository to track my progress MDES. Unfortunately I am not able to make it work. (PS shm... please help!) I also learned how to make a folder. I am excited about the potential of the next project as well. Ive been thinking about what to make. I am thinking about playful items or things that move. i saw a few projects on instructables that were pretty cool. [(iot projects)](https://www.instructables.com/Spark-Projects/)

**Reflection**
Finally a chill week in TDF. I loved receiving a box of toys and think about its potential.

# Weekly Report 3 - September 13, 2023 
(P.S. I reversed the order of the reports so that the latest was first. Too lazy to scroll down to review edits.)

**Summary**

I took a break from modeling this weekend. I used the time to figure out what I wanted to learn next in grasshopper and why. After doing something simple like the bat in grasshopper I decided to actually create something a little more complicated. I also learned more plugins like Kangaroo and Lunchbox to play with tensile strength and texture. For this project, I created the sole of the shoe in Rhino and built a pattern from it with Lunchbox. 

**Speculation**

I decided not to add texture to the bat that I worked on perviously.  I focused this week on, yes, watching more tutorials, but really on a design that is 1) more complex in shape and surface 2) that I can play with different parameters and 3) try a bit of texture. 

I did some market research for parametric design on shoes and also looked up more tutorials and tips. This [blog post](https://parameterizing.wordpress.com/2017/11/02/parametric-design-and-footwear-industry/) was a great intro on the latest in parametric design in shoes, manufacturing, and products on the market. As an industrial designer in the outdoor and sporting goods industry it was inspiring to see the possibilities of parametric design and the future of manufacturing. Possibly for small scale, custom, or sustainable manufacturing. 

4D Design Manufacturing

Addidas Shoe
“Futurecraft 4D is a prototype and a statement of intent. We have used a one-of-its-kind combination of process and material in an entirely new way. Our 3D-printed midsole not only allows us to make a great running shoe, but also to use performance data to drive truly bespoke experiences, meeting the needs of any athlete.” [(via parameterizing.wordpress.com)](https://parameterizing.wordpress.com/2017/11/02/parametric-design-and-footwear-industry/) 

<img width="500" alt="Addidas Futurecraft" src="weekly-reports/week3/screen-shot-2017-10-18-at-10-44-57.png">

New Balance was able to take it one step further by using a powder form of TPU called DuraForm TPU using selective laser sintering (SLS. They partnered with 3Dsystems for this project.Here you can see the analysis of pressure points, application of the data on a a parametric design of the sole. [(via parameterizing.wordpress.com)](https://parameterizing.wordpress.com/2017/11/02/parametric-design-and-footwear-industry/)

Circular manufacturing
Many companies are redefining their design process to reflect sustainable practices. Nike has made an effort to put that practice of circular design into high concept products to test these ideas before bringing them to the market. With [Nike ISPA](https://www.dezeen.com/2022/04/29/nike-ispa-link-disassembly/) breaks down the components of a shoe to create a design that is glueless and adaptable. [Nike circular Design](https://www.nikecirculardesign.com/)

<img width="300" alt="Nike ISPA BREAK" src="weekly-reports/week3/Nike-ISPA-disassembly_dezeen_2364_col_8-1704x1176.jpg">

There are so many improved performance and sustainable manufacturing applications to parametric design in sporting gear. I created some sketches and of course I watched more Grasshopper tutorials so I can understand how to really create a working grasshopper model. I used the shoe sole as the basis of my form. My goal was not to reinvent the shoe but understand the process of parametric design so I can be able to take it one step further in similar products. 

Sketches: I drew out possible applications of an adaptable shoe sole for a variety of activities. Then I drew out possible processes to build out the sole in Rhino and Grasshopper based on some of the tutorials I watched. 

<img width="500" alt="Sketch2" src="weekly-reports/week3/IMG_1678.png"><img width="500" alt="Rock Climbing Shoe" src="weekly-reports/week3/IMG_1677.png"> <img width="300" alt="sketch3" src="weekly-reports/week3/IMG_1682.png">

Tensile Strength: Playing with the Kangaroo plugin was interesting but complicated. I created the outline of a shoe using curves in Rhino. I then used Kangaroo to test play with the tensile strength. The curve was too complicated so the end model was too dense.


<img width="300" alt="kangaroo1" src="weekly-reports/week3/IMG_1656 copy.jpg"> <img width="300" alt="kangaroo2" src="weekly-reports/week3/IMG_1662 copy.jpg">


I found a tutorial that simplified the process of designing the shoe sole by using cage edit too in Rhino. I then used "rebuild" to make the surface even cleaner with less U and V points. This helped in creating a uniform pattern that I created in Grasshopper with the Lunchbox plugin. I finally got something to work yay! Well very much thanks to this tutorial. 

<img width="300" alt="Lunchbox1" src="weekly-reports/week3/IMG_1689 copy.jpg"> <img width="300" alt="Lunchbox2" src="weekly-reports/week3/IMG_1690 copy.jpg"><img width="300" alt="Lunchbox3" src="weekly-reports/week3/IMG_1694 copy.jpg">

**Reflection**

For this project I would like to consider myself as an "Expert" because I explored beyond the cell phone prompt. But by no means am I really an expert at grasshopper and am only tapping the surface of its capabilities. My end result was not one idea or product but a series of studies in grasshopper. I did enjoy learning a new process and researching more about its possible applications for the future of product design in particular performance gear and sustainable manufacturing. I hope to explore more in terms of parametric design in soft goods product development. 
Here is a video of my process up to this point. 

Things I need to work on: 1) Soft goods exploration with rhino and grasshopper 2) organizing my github uploads 3) I like Github, setting up a repository for my work here at MDes.

# Weekly Report 2 - September 5, 2023

**Summary**

I am still trying to wrap my head around GH. Every time I think I have it, something doesn't connect and I am back at square one. Ive been a solidworks, fusion 360 user for years and I have to relearn rhino and in a way break it down to smaller bits in GH. I did laser cut something. 

<img width="200" alt="Laser cut" src="weekly-reports/IMG_1455 copy.jpg">

So I watched more Grasshopper tutorials. 

Playing with curves...
<img width="200" alt="Curves" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-ollioll/blob/main/weekly-reports/9-4c.jp)"> <img width="200" alt="More Curves" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-ollioll/blob/main/weekly-reports/9-4a.jpg">

More help from Tj...
<img width="200" alt="TJ" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-ollioll/blob/main/weekly-reports/9-5e.PNG">

Maybe one day, texture...
<img width="200" alt="texture" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-ollioll/blob/main/weekly-reports/9-4b.jpg"> <img width="200" alt="more texture" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-ollioll/blob/main/weekly-reports/9-5d.jpg">

**Speculation**

There is an opportunity to use the tools of computational design for high performance gear for sports or training i.e. track running shoes, helmets, strapping,  etc. If only I can get a handle on relearning how to do rhino and getting a better idea on how GH works. Its not for the lack of trying. I did some initial research on it but so far I only found very circular articles but nothing direct -  [computational design for sports building](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705816307329/), [The Design Space of Wearables for Sports and Fitness Practices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350194848_The_Design_Space_of_Wearables_for_Sports_and_Fitness_Practices) and [computational design for bio feedback in sports](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2016/4829452/).

**Reflection**

I know how I want to use the computational design but am not technically connecting the dots to make what I want out of it yet. So I modeled something simple in rhino and then used the same steps to create parameters in Grasshopper. I would like to take this further by adding more parameters or possibly adding texture. I used a bat as a representative of an opportunity to create design parameters for 
technical performance gear.

# Weekly Report 1 - August 27, 2023

**Summary**

I am a noob! At least with Github and markdown. I am also wrapping my head around all the infomation in the course. Its because I'm pretty much a noob at it all. Except Rhino. I have used Rhino a long time ago so I reviewed all the intro videos as a refresher. Grasshopper on the other hand is new to me and not sure of its applications just yet. 

<img width="200" alt="Rhino1" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-ollioll/blob/main/weekly-reports/IMG_1273(1)%20copy.jpg"> <img width="200" alt="Rhino2" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-ollioll/blob/main/weekly-reports/IMG_1274%20copy.jpg"> <img width="200" alt="Rhino3" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-ollioll/blob/main/weekly-reports/IMG_1275%20copy.jpg"> 

I looked into it further. I read [Grasshopper 3D: A Modeling Software Redefining The Design Process](https://parametric-architecture.com/grasshopper-3d-a-modeling-software-redefining-the-design-process/) When I have time I will look into this as well. [Design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) for industrial design speaker series](https://www.ntop.com/resources/blog/design-for-additive-manufacturing-dfam-for-industrial-design-speaker-series/) Its applications are pretty cool and have really changed the face of architecture and industrial design. But my thought is which came first the chicken or the egg? Who designed it the software or the designer? 

As an industrial designer, one of the things I have been thinking about is how AI can do product design. And from the images below looks like AI generated architecture and product design. If we use our design software to guide our design process, why not just have it do the whole design. 

<img width="500" alt="Grasshopper in Architecture" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-ollioll/blob/main/weekly-reports/Pattern-Design-HBZstadium_PA_JOBS_01-1024x640.jpg"> <img width="500" alt="Grasshopper in ID" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-ollioll/blob/main/weekly-reports/70ab2a0b895b68ebda8fb6031e7c2f1293c1912b.jpeg"> 

**Speculation**

I watched a few videos on the possibilities of using plugins in Grasshopper. I experimented with a few plugins - Weaverbird, Mesh+, Pufferfish, and Human. Not all worked because I work on a Mac. I made progress by watching videos and hounding TJ on Slack. He has been very helpful.

# August 30, 2023

**Reflection**

I have watched a ton of videos and downloaded a few plugins. I started with weaverbird and mesh+ but the components of mesh+ did not register on my mac. So I had to think of a different way. I used the mesh forms from weaverbird and just used traditional tools to try to manipulate the form to fit my phone. I have reached a good point in actually making a shape and having my phone fit into it. The organization of the file is a mess but I feel good about where I am. I feel like I understand grasshopper but still think solid modeling is easier.

After some back and forth with TJ, he suggested a different action into creating the phone cutout on the form. It looks promising but I am unable to see the cutout.
