# Hello DES INV 202 Student!
Welcome to your new GitHub repository! 

If you’re new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that’s hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it’s super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link! 

The specific file that I’m typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (💡 TIP: The .md indicates that we’re using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (💡 TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis 😄</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the “front page” of your GitHub repo. This is where we’ll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions). They might look something like this: ###

# Example Report 1 - Week of 08/21/2023 #
This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

or, if you prefer, you can create separate files and link to them here, like so:

---
[Example Report 1](weekly-reports/example-report-1.md)

Either way, it's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions -- Don't worry, I already copied them over to another file for you [here.](welcomeREADME.md) So feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

sparkles,

your TDF TA, shm :sparkles:

PS: let me know if you have any questions!!

# August 27, 2023 Github and .md Noob right here! 

I am wrapping my head around all the infomation with the course. Its very detailed but very dense and not easy to follow. Its because Im pretty much a noob at it all. Except Rhino. I have used Rhino a long time ago so I reviewed all the intro videos as a refresher. Grasshopper on the other hand is new to me and not sure of its applications just yet. 

I mean I sort of get it. I looked into it further. I read [Grasshopper 3D: A Modeling Software Redefining The Design Process](https://parametric-architecture.com/grasshopper-3d-a-modeling-software-redefining-the-design-process/) When I have time I will look into this as well. [Design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) for industrial design speaker series](https://www.ntop.com/resources/blog/design-for-additive-manufacturing-dfam-for-industrial-design-speaker-series/)
Its applications are pretty cool and have really changed the face of architecture and industrial design. But my thought is which came first the chicken or the egg? Who designed it the software or the designer?
