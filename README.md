# Weekly Report 1 - August 27, 2023

**Summary**

I am a noob! At least with Github and markdown. I am also wrapping my head around all the infomation in the course. Its because I'm pretty much a noob at it all. Except Rhino. I have used Rhino a long time ago so I reviewed all the intro videos as a refresher. Grasshopper on the other hand is new to me and not sure of its applications just yet.

I looked into it further. I read [Grasshopper 3D: A Modeling Software Redefining The Design Process](https://parametric-architecture.com/grasshopper-3d-a-modeling-software-redefining-the-design-process/) When I have time I will look into this as well. [Design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) for industrial design speaker series](https://www.ntop.com/resources/blog/design-for-additive-manufacturing-dfam-for-industrial-design-speaker-series/) Its applications are pretty cool and have really changed the face of architecture and industrial design. But my thought is which came first the chicken or the egg? Who designed it the software or the designer? 

As an industrial designer, one of the things I have been thinking about is how AI can do product design. And from the images below looks like AI generated architecture and product design. If we use our design software to guide our design process, why not just have it do the whole design.

**Speculation**

I watched a few videos on the possibilities of using plugins in Grasshopper. I experimented with a few plugins - Weaverbird, Mesh+, Pufferfish, and Human. Not all worked because I work on a Mac. I made progress by watching videos and hounding TJ on Slack. He has been very helpful.

**Reflection**

I have watched a ton of videos and downloaded a few plugins. I started with weaverbird and mesh+ but the components of mesh+ did not register on my mac. So I had to think of a different way. I used the mesh forms from weaverbird and just used traditional tools to try to manipulate the form to fit my phone. I have reached a good point in actually making a shape and having my phone fit into it. The organization of the file is a mess but I feel good about where I am. I feel like I understand grasshopper but still think solid modeling is easier.

After some back and forth with TJ, he suggested a different action into creating the phone cutout on the form. It looks promising but I am unable to see the cutout.

# Weekly Report 2 - September 5, 2023

**Summary**

I am still trying to wrap my head around GH. Every time I think I have it, something doesn't connect and I am back at square one. Ive been a solidworks, fusion 360 user for years and I have to relearn rhino and in a way break it down to smaller bits in GH. I did laser cut something. 

<img width="200" alt="Laser cut" src="weekly-reports/IMG_1455 copy.jpg">

So I watched more Grasshopper tutorials. 

Playing with curves...

More help from Tj...

Maybe one day, texture...

**Speculation**

There is an opportunity to use the tools of computational design for high performance gear for sports or training i.e. track running shoes, helmets, strapping,  etc. If only I can get a handle on relearning how to do rhino and getting a better idea on how GH works. Its not for the lack of trying. I did some initial research on it but so far I only found very circular articles but nothing direct -  [computational design for sports building](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705816307329/), [The Design Space of Wearables for Sports and Fitness Practices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350194848_The_Design_Space_of_Wearables_for_Sports_and_Fitness_Practices) and [computational design for bio feedback in sports](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2016/4829452/).

**Reflection**

I know how I want to use the computational design but am not technically connecting the dots to make what I want out of it yet. So I modeled something simple in rhino and then used the same steps to create parameters in Grasshopper. I would like to take this further by adding more parameters or possibly adding texture. I used a bat as a representative of an opportunity to create design parameters for 
technical performance gear.
